They should be moist and, depending on our preference, almost runny or with a thick creamy consistency. Overcooked eggs are dry, \"grainy,\" and devoid of the characteristic aroma that is one of the important charms of this dish.\n\nAlways fry scrambled eggs over low heat!\n\n2 eggs are the \"golden measure.\" We crack them into a saucepan or onto a plate and beat them lightly with a fork until the resulting \"emulsion\" starts to froth slightly on the surface. The more thoroughly we beat the eggs, the more delicate and \"fluffy\" the scrambled eggs will be.\n\nIn a frying pan, melt a heaping teaspoon of butter, margarine, or lard. Butter gives the scrambled eggs a specially mild aroma. The fat should be hot (but never brown the butter). Pour the lightly salted eggs onto the pan (overly salty scrambled eggs are dreadful) and, as they begin to set, mix them with a fork to ensure even cooking. Adding a tablespoon of water (preferably mineral water) or milk to the eggs before beating them will increase the volume and make them even more delicate.    2 teaspoons of grated cheese (added just before pouring the eggs onto the pan)\n    Optional: 1 tablespoon of cooked peas, finely chopped sausage or ham, or sautéed mushrooms\n    Finely chopped chives or spring onions for garnishing\n    Serve with fried potatoes and pickles for a complete meal\n    Optional: A few leaves of green salad (except in winter months) for serving\n\nThese additional ingredients will enhance the flavor, nutritional value, and appearance of the scrambled eggs."

Once soaked, pat them dry with a paper towel.\n\n    Dredge each herring fillet in flour, coating it evenly. Shake off any excess flour.\n\n    In a separate bowl, beat an egg until well combined. Dip each flour-coated herring fillet into the beaten egg, ensuring it is thoroughly coated.\n\n    Next, transfer the herring fillet from the egg mixture to a plate of breadcrumbs or crushed bread, pressing gently to adhere the breadcrumbs to the fillet. Coat both sides of the fillet with breadcrumbs.\n\n    Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add a generous amount of cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the breaded herring fillets into the pan.\n\n    Fry the herring fillets until they turn golden brown on one side, then flip them over to fry the other side. Be careful not to overcook them. Adjust the heat if necessary to prevent burning.\n\n    Once the herring fillets are cooked and crispy, reduce the heat to low and let them cook for an additional 3 minutes, allowing them to finish cooking and become tender.\n\n    Remove the fried herring fillets from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n\n    Serve the \"Śledzie smażone\" hot alongside a side dish of your choice. It goes well with potato salad or boiled potatoes and sauerkraut salad.\n\nEnjoy your delicious fried herring!"
