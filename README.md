# The Backend:
created with node.js , express.js, database is postgresSQL.
## To start Backend:

- Use Terminal  command 'cd Backend/node-api-postgres', Navigate into /Backend/node-api-postgres directory.
- Use Terminal command 'npm install' to download the node models.
- Change the credentials: in the 'queries.js' file and 'testConnection.js' file, Enter the your local postgres database's "user, host, database name, password, port". The placeholder in the code is 'do not know yet'.
- Use Terminal command 'node index.js', to run the backend server.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. There should be a json message {"info": "Node.js, Express, and Postgres API"}
- Open http://localhost:3000/recipes/?ingredients=egg,beef change the parameters to view the query result.
- To test if the backend connected well, use Terminal command "node testConnection.js"

## After running backend server, keep the server running, then run the frontend app as follow.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- when run the backend and frondend simutaneously at local, the terminal would ask "Something is already running on port 3000. Probably:
  node index.js (pid 87789), Would you like to run the app on another port instead? â€º (Y/n)
  " type "Y", to run the frontend at port 3001.
- Then the web page can be view at [http://localhost:3001]
- The page will reload when you make changes.\
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.
  


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
